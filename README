edgecase
========

Edgecase is a GUI test runner that handles a suite of test executables,
that can be written using multiple test frameworks.

The basic usage is to point edgecase to a directory containing your test
executables. Edgecase can run all tests within it (and its subdirs,
if desired) and then report run/pass counts, failure messages, benchmark
results, etc.

Currently edgecase supports:
  * GoogleTest (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
  * QTestLib   (http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtestlib-manual.html)

To support multiple testing frameworks, some sort of convention has to be
followed for edgecase to discover test executables at runtime and handle
them properly (different command-line args, different output formats, etc.)
Thus edgecase requires a test executable to have one of several built-in
filename prefixes:
  * GoogleTest - 'gtest_*', 'gtst_*'
  * QTestLib   - 'qtest_*', 'qtst_*', and 'tst_*'

Building
------------------

Edgecase is built on top of the Qt framework (v4.6+)

  http://qt-project.org/downloads

Download & install if needed, per instructions there.
Note - edgecase hasn't been tested with Qt5.

Using QtCreator:
  Open the project file (edgecase.pro) in QtCreator.
  Click the "Build" button.

From command-line:
  $ qmake edgecase.pro
  $ make
